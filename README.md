# Scribblespace
Scribblespace is a simple notebook app that allows users to save and view their notes. The GUI is created using the Tkinter library in Python and consists of a Text widget where the notes can be written, and a Save button. The notes are saved to a file called scribbles.txt, which can be viewed after the program is restarted.
