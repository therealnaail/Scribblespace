# Scribblespace
Scribblespace is a user-friendly notebook application that enables users to conveniently save and access their notes. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library in Python and features a Text widget to input and view notes, as well as a Save button for saving notes. The notes are stored in a file named "scribbles.txt" which can be easily retrieved even after restarting the program.
